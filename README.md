# React Photo Selector

A simple yet effective web app for photo selection in a form of responsive image gallery built with React and react-photo-view. It allows users to view (thumbnails, full screen mode), like/dislike, and rate images (5-star rating). The layout is responsive and the images are neatly arranged in rows regardless of their orientation (portrait or landscape).
